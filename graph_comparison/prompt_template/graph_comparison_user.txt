Based on the given descriptions of the unseen dataset and multiple benchmark datasets below, please take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step: analyze the characteristics of datasets that affect their choice of best GNN architectures in practice and estimate the task similarity scores between the unseen dataset and each benchmark dataset. The task similarity score should range from 0 (completely dissimilar tasks) to 1 (identical tasks). Here are the descriptions for the benchmark datasets one-by-one:
